I systematically conducted an analysis by determining the range between the minimum and maximum values within the dataset. Subsequently, I undertook demographic comparisons within these ranges. For instance, I juxtaposed the earnings of individuals with advanced degrees to those without high school education, considering both the best and worst-case scenarios. This process was replicated by gender, wherein I examined wage differentials between females and males in these extreme scenarios. Extending the analysis further, I compared the best and worst-case scenarios among ethnicities, categorized by gender, and subsequently conducted cross-comparisons. Ultimately, I synthesized the data by examining the earliest available year (representing the minimum) and the most recent year (representing the maximum) to show how it has changed over the years.
